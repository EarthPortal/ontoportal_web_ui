      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
      Many vocabularies and ontologies are produced to represent and annotate Earth and Environmental data. Therefore, there is a need of
      a common platform to identify, host and use them in earth-informatics application. The EarthPortal project aims to offer
      a reference ontology repository for Earth Sciences, reusing the NCBO BioPortal and AgroPortal technology. We offer an ontology portal which features ontology hosting, search, versioning,
      visualization, comment, recommendation, enables semantic annotation, fairness assessment, as well as storing and exploiting ontology alignments.
      All of these within a fully semantic web compliant infrastructure. The EarthPortal specifically pays attention to respect the
      requirements of the Earth community in terms of ontology formats (e.g., SKOS, OWL) or supported features.
      EarthPortal project is based on five driving earth use cases which participate in the design and orientation of the platform.
      EarthPortal already offers a robust and stable reference repository highly valuable for the Earth domain.

      sample_text: As the access to Solid Earth data is not facilitated for now, current activities are focused on the development of a new portal/service to evaluate automatically SO2 flux emissions by volcanoes by analysis of satellite observations from the Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI sensor together with ECMWF wind fields. Several publications are also in preparation for 1- the presentation of the new service (SO2 flux calculator) and its theoretical framework, 2- the scientific applications of these new services, in particular the analysis of specific eruptions and their impacts on the atmosphere (air quality, climate) using the VOLCPLUME webportal (under further development).
